<p>	A while back, I stumbled upon 3Lateral's Osiris Black performance capture demo on YouTube. The demo features motion capture performer, Andy Serkis, performing the closing monologue of Shakespeare's MacBeth. All the while, 3Lateral's Meta Human Framework translated Serkis' performance to both a CG double and an alient character with an amazing level of nuance and impact. That clip still remains as one of my favorite videos due to the sheer amount of synergy the video was able to put forth, and it got me hooked on searching for other great performances of Shakespearean monologues.
	Eventually, I stumbled upon the Shakespeare Solos series by The Guardian. The first video in this series was of Damian Lewis as Marc Antony in Julius Caesar. Lewis puts an interesting twist on Antony's famous "Lend me your ears" monologue by delivering a much more intimate performance ____. Everything from the delivery to the color scheme. If I didn't fear of boring you further, I could go on and on about every little thing I love about this video. 
	I'm sure, by now, you've caught onto what I intend to do. I want to see if I can attempt to recreate Lewis' performance from scratch using the video as reference. The image above is the initial sculpt I was able to knock out in an afternoon and I am a good amount of the way through retopologizing it. I know that I will most likely not be able to reach the level of 3Lateral's framework. They probably have a whole team of specialized individuals and years of development behind it. However, I do believe that this will serve as an excellent exercise. </p>
