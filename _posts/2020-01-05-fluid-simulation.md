This is a rework of an old project from high school. I was able to find a chapter of a book by NVIDIA that
explains both the mathematics and the implementation process of making a basic 2D fluid simulation. 
The book, GPU Gems, is an excellent resource for anybody that has an interest in Computer Graphics. 
The book is available [online](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-vi-beyond-triangles/chapter-38-fast-fluid-dynamics-simulation-gpu) and I highly advise checking it out.
